**Hello there!** My name is Stone Fields. I am an undergraduate Mathematics student at Texas Tech University with a minor in Technical Communication. While I am passionate about mathematical research, I am equally dedicated to mindful, effective communication and the exploration of both the world and the self.

Initially, I was a humanities-focused student throughout middle and high school. However, after taking Calculus III and Linear Algebra, I met my advisor Álvaro Pámpano and began researching topics in Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. Studying mathematics has strengthened my logical thinking while also teaching me the value of resilience and the importance of entering a flow state.

Unfortunately, time is finite, and I cannot learn everything I would like to. As a result, I explore the intersections of my major and minor—not only through mathematical research but also through critiques of films, books, and other media. I strive to connect these fields under the broader themes of teaching and self-improvement. The vehicle for such themes is through the essay. The french word "essai" means "attempt" - everything begins with an attempt; it all begins with scratch work. It is through trial and error that I believe most topics - including mathematics and English - can be united.
