One of my favorite movies of the 21st century, Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is a cluttered yet simultaneously cohesive masterpiece. In this review, I argue that The Daniels undertook an ambitious venture by uniting the seemingly endless nature of reality into something intimate and emotional, an action packed that defies genre norms; it is a piece of media that simultaneously expands your consciousness, yet grounds your very being. {{< embed-pdf url="/Reviews/Movie_Reviews/EEEAOT.pdf">}}
