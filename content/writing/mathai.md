title = 'Ethical Analysis of AI Use in Mathematics'


+++

Mathematics is an art, and as such demands a certain level of respect to preserve its aesthetic integrity. Such a task can be very difficult, especially in the age of AI, in which it is now easier than ever to use external means of solving a problem. This paper analyzes the ethical implications of AI use, and poses the argument that inappropriate use of such tools can demean an incredibly experience worth having: the training of resilience, logical rigor, and mathematical unity and beauty.
