title = 'George Orwell Style Analysis'


+++

Orwell is known as one of the most critically accalimed writers of the 21st century due to his unprecendented foresight of dystopian futures. However, an overlooked aspect of his success in writing can be attributed to his incredibly concrete and vivacious writing style. Through the use of fresh metaphors and concrete language, Orwell is able to create densely packed political perspective imbued with a simple and approachable prose. In this analysis, I point out such uses in his work Homage to Catalonia.
