title = 'Cormac McCarthy Immitation Piece'
+++
This artifact is a creative fiction short story that emulates the style of Cormac McCarthy. McCarthy is one of my favorite authors, and I really wanted to tackle his prose. Some people call his prose incredibly "muscular", and with this story I created something that played on McCarthy's stark, non-punctuated, and existential story-telling.
