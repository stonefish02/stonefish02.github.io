I watched this movie under the supervision of my movie senseis Eben and Knox.

Annihilation. This movie has a somewhat unlikable cast of characters, and it feels as though there are a lot of gaps in this movie’s motivation. Yes, I get it that these characters are incredibly troubled and thus are willing to essentially go on a suicide mission to obtain more information about the light house, but why only these 5 people? I know they are all crazy and traumatized, but still. Maybe I should care less about the lens cap being on the camera, but I feel like this movie leaves a lot of questions regarding the characters and their motives. Another gripe I have is that the dialogue is incredibly simplistic. Though, it could be argued that this simple dialogue is rather sparse intentionally, which could be lending to the general puzzle that is this film. The characters at times felt somewhat flat, which led me to feeling slightly disconnected from the film at times.

However, though I think this, the idea of the shimmer is so amazing that I feel as though it really makes up for these shortcomings, but certainly precludes this from being a perfect movie. That being said, the spectacle of this movie is AMAZING. The idea of creating a force that prisms and splinters DNA, memories, and energy is super cool. The visuals of the people who are changed into plants with their fungal entrails cyphering the wall is something that will occupy my visual memory for a very long time, then the realization that this person is the person whom Kane cut open on camera is such a visceral realization that turned my gut in on itself.

This prism also presents a fundamental question about our identity and brings to mind the Theseus brain - a thought experiment that attempts to tackle problems of self. If every part of your body and cells was replaced with someone else’s, you likely would not experience any discontinuity in your experience. This scenario creates a bind where you feel the same, but everyone sees you differently. We can clearly see that characters change quite drastically throughout the film, falling deeper into their afflictions. One of the elements I really appreciate about this movie is that this movie is like a prism which scatters and changes the entirety of the movie depending on how you think about it. For instance, who is Lena? Moreover, who are you?

This film pushes forward the notion that our sense of self is thought to be directly tied to our experiences, memories, and traumas. For instance, Josie becomes plant. This presents a lot of questions that might not be directly answerable. Why does she accept becoming a creation of the prism? Is it because she realized there were no hopes of escaping the shimmer? Or, as a physicist did she recognize the beauty in being changed by the shimmer, to be the subject of an unprecedented physical phenomena? She is also known to have self-harmed, with scars on her wrist, and she wishes to disappear – much like people with depression who wish to fade away from people’s memory. I’m not really sure. But, that maybe emphasizes the mirror like quality of this movie. Depending on your perspective, the answer to this changes – it fractures and shifts depending on your perspective.

Ventress has these preconceptions that the alien would annihilate the world, and is therefore annihilated and created and destroyed where there is no ending to the ending. This maybe emphasizes her self-destructive tendencies, where she is willing to be annihilated because of her cancer diagnosis. People deal with their traumas in fundamentally different ways, and Lena is the type to run away from her past. The alien confronts her directly, showing that you can not truly run away from the past. It is only until this that she is able to kill the alien and accept this.

This movie explores questions of trauma and identity – two ideas which I believe are to a degree inseparable. When you enter the shimmer, it completely splinters every essence of your being. When Lena looks under the microscope she sees complete distortions in her red blood cells. If every part of her body is different, what really constructs her being? I believe this is a question that cannot be answered, and Lena certainly does not know herself, hence the ending in which the alien version of Kane asks if she is Lena, and she does not respond. It is very likely that she does not know who Lena is anymore, especially after such a traumatic experience. This line is incredibly powerful, and answers the question of self: maybe there really is not definite way of saying who you are, and that the question might be ill posed.

Very good movie overall, but I think there could have been more effort into making these characters slightly more likable and there are some weird plot motivations which bother me. But, this movie makes up for this with a very interesting scenario rich in allegory – one in which identity and our euclidean concepts of what separates one from another, and each other from the world are called into question. I believe that my experience watching this will only get better after a future re-watch, but I keep it at 4 star for now to give me some room for variance.

4/5
