The Big Lebowski.

This movie is interesting, because it has a really horrible Movie poster and at first glance seemed like another Hangover or Grown-ups type comedy movie. My assumptions were completely wrong and this movie has since grown to be one of my favorites.

Overall, this movie is on one hand about Nihilism. What is the meaning of life? Why is it that I keep putting up with the horrible things happening in my life? Why am I stuck in a dead-end job? Is it really all for naught? Well, one thing you should know: while you were sitting here complaining about such things, the dude is out there abiding. The dude abides.

Everything about this movie slaps, the soundtrack is awesome and fitting, and there are iconic moments where the movie is self-conscious of itself, like when The Dude wants the cab-driver to turn off the Eagles because they suck.

When I first watched this movie, it felt like an absolute fever dream. It seemed like stuff was just happening, and there wasn't even really a plot, let alone a clear resolution in the end. This might seem like a negative trait of a movie: what is the point of a story that has no clear morals or things to take away? I had a similar experience with this movie as I did with Fallen Angles by Wong Kar-wai. What the hell actually happens in this movie? I have no idea. What did I take away from it?

I mean, it might be that it actually is a bad movie if there were no redeemable qualities. But where there lacks in cohesive plot, the Big Lebowski delivers in characters. Every character in this movie belongs and is full of life. Even gag characters like Jesus and Donny add so much charm to the film. Walter is one of my personal favorites. He is literally napalm incarnate, and he just does seemingly badass things at the worst possible times and places. Plot is important, but in my eyes plot is simply a tool used to show how characters change or are challenged by a certain thesis or set of ideas; it is not necessary.

This movie is in a category of films that I love and I think are highly valuable: interpretive pieces that reflect back at the viewer. This movie is very open-ended, so much so, people have been creating theories about this movie. Theories such as The Dude's acquaintances being Jungian Representations of the Psyche, or that he is a representation of Rugged Western-Individualistic Reaganism, etc.

I feel that in this review I have barely scratched the surface. This film is filled to the brim with amalgamations of different cultural ideas and conflicts, all tied together with a bow of hilarity, sorrow and charm.

As my film sensei Knox Morris would say, this movie literally never gets old.

5/5
