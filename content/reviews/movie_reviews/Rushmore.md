Though I rate this a 4.5/5, as it's maybe not as impactful as something I would rate a 5, I have a lot to say about this movie.

To start, I am literally Max Fischer. No, it's not because I am into older women (though that has happened before and might qualify me in that regard.) No, it's not in my sheer genius at devising conniving and evil ways of getting back at my friend who "stole" said older woman. Yes, it's because I wish I could do the things that I want to do and not get bogged down by seemingly useless and monotonous stuff that I don't really care about.

This movie may not have resonated with me when I was at the beginning of High School, when I wasn't too tired of taking Art History or biology or what have you. But, it seems to me that as I edge towards the end of my Bachelor's degree, I understand why Max Fischer failed all of his classes. I for one almost failed seemingly easy classes simply because I couldn't get into them.

Though I was never put into "sudden death academic probation," I understand Max's sentiment about trying to become a well-recognized name in academics (or more generally, the world,) because I too am from a middle class background. There are some people who are absolutely stacked in these worlds: wealthy families, 100 page long CVs and pedigrees that deflate the air out of you before you even begin to talk about your recent project's progress.

But in this lies a problem: you can not do everything. Even if you enjoy doing everything. Even people like Von Neumann couldn't learn it all. The world is not about finding a needle in a haystack; there really are just a ton of needles embedded inside of needle stacks. The world is your oyster! There are so many things to do in life such as writing a play, visiting your friends or just enjoying a walk down the street. Max erroneously is of the mindset that you can do all this - I can make a club, I can be a fencer, etc.

Finitude is in plain sight, but I think most people like to ignore the impermanent nature of things. Everything in life is this way, even life itself. So its begs the question: how do we deal with impermanence? How is one to comes to grips with the fact that their life is in fact transient? And when you arrive at deaths door, life having passed in the blink of an eye, how do you look back on all of that and say "yeah, I lived my life to the fullest."

I think this movie embodies this transition from doing everything to really making the best with what needles we can possibly have in the world. Max after being kicked out of Rushmore and his betrayal by Blume indicate this idea: you can not force things to happen. Things can be simply out of your control, like your love being older than you or you simply not having what it takes to succeed in a certain environment. Max torches a lot of these bridges because he can not come to grip with the idea that life is unfair, and that you can't get what you want.

This transition is rough, but in this, Max learns that he simply has to accept where he is. He is no longer at Rushmore, his dad isn't a Neurosurgeon, and he never will get the girl he's loved.

But this is exactly when it seems his life seems to turn around for the better: he starts mending his relationship with Blume, he gets a girlfriend who cares about him, and he even fixes a seemingly hopeless relationship Rosemary, who was still in love with some dead guy. Finally, he creates the magnum opus of his career.

I think that Max recognizes he can't be the best of the best at everything. He can't be a top student at Rushmore. I think Max tapers his expectations and this is when things truly become good for him: when he realizes that there is only so much we can do in life and its about doing what we enjoy, caring for other people and burying the hatchet; destroying the radio silence that need not exist. Plus, he did save Latin guys.

4.5/5
