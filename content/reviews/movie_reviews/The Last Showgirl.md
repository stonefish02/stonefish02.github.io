The Last Showgirl is an American film released in 2024 starring Pamela Anderson. Pamela plays Shelly Gardner, a long term Showgirl at La Razzle Dazzle. She possesses an innate struggle with her occupation and her role as a mother, and also the general stigmatization of showgirl business. Such struggle manifests in prejudice, self-hatred, and a desire for amending her relationship with her daughter and other dancers. This movie investigates some heavy topics, including mortality, beauty, and motherhood, all of which blend together to create a very touching meditation. However, there are a few crucial problems with this film.

These problems mostly lie in the fact that so many events and backstories are given exposition, but none of them are actually expounded upon or are given a clear/earned resolution. For instance, the major plot point in this movie centers on Shelly and her daughter Hannah which has an underdeveloped resolution. There is a significant amount of tension between these two, with Shelly clearly not being the mother she should have been for Hannah, which is implicitly mentioned through stories of Hannah never having a babysitter, waiting for her mother in the parking lot for her to finish her dances. Hannah finally sees one of Shelly’s shows, and is heartbroken at the fact that Shelly’s lack of presence was due to this occupation - a demonstration of societal disdain for female performers - which sets up a clear form of adversity for Shelly. In the end, it is insinuated that Hannah forgives Shelly, but there is little to no detail given as to why this is - at least how Hannah rationalized this or overcame these socially induced biases.

There is also the plot point when one of Shelly’s coworkers, Jodie, shows up to her house in tears and is asking for Shelly to let her in because her parents refuse to speak to her. Shelly closes the door in her face, but in the end, Jodie completely forgives her and all is pretty much well. It really seems as though Shelly (understandably) is having a midlife crisis, and that people just seemingly forgive her because they implicitly understand what is going on in her mind. Such thoughts are completely unrealistic, and I believe unearned. I think the point of this scene was to be a bifurcation point, in which Pamela’s hatred for other dancers (maybe self-hatred, even) began to affect those she loved, those who looked up to her as a mother figure, but it felt like this moment meant nothing with this thread being put down and never picked up again.

There are a few other moments like this throughout the movie which bother me, such as Eddie’s reveal as Hannah’s father being relegated to the sidelines…this movie is not very careful in the realm of creating satisfying conclusions.

Though this movie is lacking in the realm of plot and sometimes writing, there are some major strong points to this film which were incredibly moving. Strong acting, profound ideas, and some insane needle drops were enough to open the floodgates. Pamela Anderson gives the performance of a lifetime, Shelly being an incredibly complex and layered person with contradictions and shortcomings, yet a good heart who hopes to redeem these qualities. Shelly has a lot of awkward moments which heighten the tension between characters, with these moments significantly changing her relationship to others AND herself.

Shelly Gardner is friends with a former showgirl, Annette, who is played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Annette was previously fired from le Razzle Dazzle, and serves as a companion surviving in Las Vegas, surviving in a position where women who age in this business are cast off into darkness. There is an incredible scene where Jamie Lee Curtis, after a long shift and a general air of disappointment, gets upon a dancing stage and dances to Total Eclipse of the Heart. Oh. My. God. This dance was so insanely amazing, and Jamie Lee Curtis’s performance in this role alone made me tear up. Annette serves as some kind of counter to Shelly’s personality, with Annette being fired and working as a casino attendant in which she is largely ignored. Such a context demonstrates the volatile nature of these businesses, in which veterans are parted to make room for younger dancers. I love this scene so much, because Jamie Lee Curtis embodies one of the highest forms of beauty through her expression - demonstrating a major critique of the show business industry, where it is supposed that youth itself is beautiful.

This notion of people being past the prime of their life, and on the murkiness of nostalgia is accentuated by Shelly’s insulting of dancers at a new showgirl business, in which she calls them “trashy” or “hussies,” citing La Razzle Dazzle’s beginnings in France to highlight a supposed difference in purity. This prejudice culminates when she auditions for a dancing position, in which she gives her routine and the judge quickly stops the dance. She is frustrated, and does some of the dance routines Jodie shows her that were quite revealing and lascivious, noting the conflict within her: the reconciliation of her artform and its negative connotation within society. The movie does a great job of critiquing this hypocrisy, rather than perpetuating it. Such an ouroboros - a negative feedback loop - creates an outcome, in which people begin to believe that what people say about them is true.

Though the plot did not deliver, the ideas certainly did. Pamela Anderson in her last voicemail to her daughter says “Our mothers are not saints or saviors, just regular people doing the best they can with the tools they have.” I remember tearing up when this was said, because it reminds me of how difficult a time my mother had in raising my sister and I. She was not perfect and she made a lot of mistakes along the way. Though she is my hero, it is important to understand that people are heroes not because they are perfect people or possess awesome virtue all the time. It is a struggle, a multifaceted tapestry that can not be blanketed with a simple adjective. As my wise friend Lex has said: not saints, not whores, just women. Again, it would have been nice to be more inside of Shelly’s head when she comes to this new found form of empathy for other dancers. The ideas in this film could have been mulled over and chewed for longer to create more nuanced and clear commentary on beauty, social commentary, and empathy.

This movie has reinforced an empathy that I feel for people who work in show business or in dancing, and has afforded me a new set of questions to be answered, such as the question of what constitutes beauty. Though I think the ending deserved more work, and the plot is not given the adversity deserved, the ending with Pamela Anderson dancing her last show to Beautiful that Way by Miley Cyrus made me tear up again. Man, this movie simultaneously was so moving, but kind of frustrating at the same time. I wish there were more consequences of the character’s actions explored, and less loose ends. I believe that you should watch this movie, but I won’t lie that I feel like there was so much untapped potential that was not honed in on here.
