Utterly baffling. The worst movie I have ever seen, which has quite the allure. My personal hell consists in being the football passed between Johnny and his supposed best friend Mark. Is Tommy even playing a character or is he just in the movie?

0/5 or 5/5, imagine you take the equivalence relation ~ that maps 0 to 1 on the interval [0,1) and you get S^1. This movie is the unit circle.
