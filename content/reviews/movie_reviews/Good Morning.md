I feel strange having written all these reviews that have 4.5 or 5 stars, but I feel as if I have been spoiled by my movie parents.

In any case, Good Morning by Ozu is a seemingly pretty silly movie. From button-activated flatulence to just wanting a damn TV to watch Sumo wrestling - not a whole lot happens in this movie. I think where this movie truly shines is in visual prowess. I wish Ozu would come into my home and show me what I am doing wrong. This movie is beautiful in terms of color coordination and set design.

Another aspect of his visual prowess, which seems sort of frivolous expands on something very profound: fake nicety and hospitality only serve to denigrate your relationship with people. In most of these frames Ozu breaks something called the "180-degree rule." A lot of his shots have it so that the characters are literally staring at you, and then in the flash back it's slightly off-kilter. The perspective of the camera is as the listener might hear.

This creates an effect which in some way dehumanizes or makes the person look kind of "phoney." They seem like wax figures. This seems a little strange, but a more commonplace example might be when you see NPCs in certain video games like Skyrim or Fallout. Faces stare straight into the camera and it creates sort of a "flattening" of people. It looks and feels inhuman.

This might seem unintentional, but I think Ozu is using this effect to critique our social interactions with people (though it seems more pointed towards Japan.) There is a lot of fake niceness portrayed in the film, embodied by this constant reiterations of "good morning" by the adults. This film is genius in a way, because the most pointed criticisms are always from the neighborhood kids who poke holes in the adult world. 

Kids in certain aspects are smarter than us. They have not been weathered down by social cues and conventions. A fart is good enough. In the midst of all of these social conventions, a lot of information is loss. The adversity in this film is entirely based on the adults' inability to communicate with each other. The kids literally took a vow of silence and were on a better plane of communications than the neighbors who have maybe known each other for a very long time. 

What I took from this film: do less small talk, be more like kids. Sum this critique with the sort of "homeliness" of the film and the light-hearted humor that is more characteristic of the laughs we might share with our close bodies or family and I think you have a fantastic film. Thanks for reading.
I love you.

5/5
