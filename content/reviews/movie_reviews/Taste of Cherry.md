This movie is uncomfortable in subject matter and also in execution. Suicide is a difficult topic to get right, as evident from media that depicts it such as 13 reasons why; that is, it is easy to glorify such things when the intent might be to de-stigmatize, but I think this movie strikes a very beautiful medium in portraying it.

Badii beats around the bush, he is pointed sometimes and in the end he gets someone to assist him in the act of taking his life. Again, there are super uncomfortable moments, such as the soldier at the beginning who knows his aim and won't do so because it feels wrong. Then there is the student who won't do it out of principle. These scenes are sometimes very awkward. Badii always talks about them, but never about himself.

You don't even explicitly know the reason why he is wanting to commit suicide in the first place. It's just you watching Badii become more desperate as people refuse and frantic as the event draws closer. Windy turns and high places, the long takes of Badii driving around makes me incredibly nauseous.

I can only imagine how Badii felt trying to gain the infamous courage to transcend the boundary of pain into death. Does he actually gain the courage? Does he wake up, Bagheri throwing the stone and ultimately being vindicated? Maybe all you need to be saved is the taste of mulberries. Simply being here, right now. Consciousness might be good enough as it is. But maybe it's not enough, perhaps he was long due for an eternal rest.

The ending, I believe, is interpretive. One thing that really resonated with me is that this film is reflective of the individual. This is imaginative art at its best. A quote that encapsulates the beauty of this film:

"Every reader, as he reads, is actually the reader of himself. The writer's work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader."
- Marcel Proust

Depending on where you are in life, Badii died, or he lived.

4.5/5
