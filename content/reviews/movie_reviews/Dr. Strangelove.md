I watched this movie under the supervision of my movie sensei Knox.

Dr. Strangelove is a military man’s wet dream, but it is certainly not a blonde haired bombshell. No, Dr. Strangelove makes the argument that the military men’s hyper masculinity and love for military superiority is so perverse that it may as well be a form of…. Strange love. Phallic imagery is on display throughout this movie, such as the airplace refueling scene, and the B52 dangling superimposed in the sky. It is very reminiscent of Thomas Pynchon, in which he equates the American rocket to the phallus. Even the president is talking like he is in bed with the Russian president.

This movie is wonderful because it is able to satirize the military without really distorting the reality of communication and action that transpires. Kubrick, no doubt due to his perfectionism, mechanically runs through the modus operandi for the bomber flight squad. These parts can be sort of slow, but I personally enjoy the technicality of this. Using excessive technical jargon is an instance of intellectualization, which is a psychological phenomena in which people avoid uncomfortable emotions by abiding by strict logic and scientific terms to describe their circumstances. There are many reasons for why this jargon may be employed, but at a higher level of abstraction lies a system devised to create an island of control in the midst of military chaos, in which communication is ceased and presidents can’t even remember the laws they create.

The premise of this film is based on General Jack D Ripper taking advantage of a clause that no one has ever heard of to drop nuclear weapons inside of Russia. The reason he cites for effectively ending the world is that communism is directly connected with certain conspiracy theories, and goes on to give exposition on the fluoridation of water (which implicitly is known for effecting the mental states of consumers.) The crazy military man with the big ol’ stogie in his mouth ranting about conspiracy theories reiterates the notion that most people who are crazy enough to be general probably should not be generals – some Catch 22isms are prevalent throughout the film like this. This also reflects the prevalence of McCarthyism in this time frame – where Communism is treated like a global conspiracy determined to uproot Western civilization’s values.

However, there comes a time where cozy military prestige is not to be desired. In the war room, Generals and bureaucrats are arguing about law and technicalities when the world is theoretically 20 minutes away from ending. There is such a disconnect between these people in the real world that they can treat people like pawns. There are hilarious double standards in this context, with General Turgidson assaulting the Premier of Russia and then the bystanders saying “no fighting in the war room” as if these men are too sophisticated to do something like fighting or harming people. A side note: I swear, General Turgidson looks and acts like a prototype of Tim Robinson’s character… The characters in this film are all top tier, including the president and his pillow talk with the drunk Russian president. Communication is hindered in a strict sense through destruction of lines, but it feels like there is always some kind of disconnection between people, some mode of interpersonal communication that has been snipped – for soldiers, officers, bureaucrats; friends and enemies.

Miscommunication is ubiquitous in the military, with a particular instance being my favorite set of scenes in this film are when ____ and the Colonel are inside of Ripper’s office. ___ has the means to essentially save the world, but Colonel is unable to understand what he is saying and basically has no idea what is going on and has to take him in. The Colonel is in utter disarray when ____ says he can contact the president, but he needs a few cents to continue the call, maybe a subtle nod to the fact that capitalism prioritizes profit over the literal survival of the human race.

Though communication is down, Dr. Strangelove has a message that everyone can get behind: eugenics and 20 women harems. Strangelove has less prominence than you might expect, but serves a necessary purpose in representing the absorption of German brainpower into the American army after World War II. Strangelove’s habit of calling everything “very simple” and going on a very technical and complicated tangent is so perfect to represent the espousing of “in-hindsight” obviousness that is common amongst academics. His rant regarding the survival of humanity in mine-shafts with harems of women and sustaining of military supremacy is both hilarious and fitting because it characterizes the eugenics based platform of the Nazi’s, and the general agreement of military leaders to “look at this from a military perspective” highlights America’s acceptance of eugenics based movements and practices back in the 1900s.

Overall, I really like this movie. It is very cohesive, has some effective, staunch critique, and is generally hilarious. Really echoes my favorite parts of Catch 22, but in movie form. Epic movie, hilarious and strange. Love!

5/5
