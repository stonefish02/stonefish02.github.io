The master and Margarita is a sprawling masterpiece which is unapologetic in its celebration of freedom and art. Deeply anti-authoritarian in nature, this opposition to the quelling of creative processes is present not only in Bulghakov’s  portrayal of Soviet society, but also composes the nature of his entire work. At first sight, this book is an absurd magical realist book which has prose typical of the genre. Most of the humor in this book has a basis in overstimulation and ridiculousness, but also in its very striking satire. One of the most beautiful things about this satire is that as you being to understand more about the history of the Soviet Union, the more poignant it becomes. Even from the very beginning in which the duo Berlioz and Ivan Homeless drink warm apricot soda is emblematic of the economic reality of the Soviet Union: constant shortages and simply making do.

This book is a rich allegory; that being, it is very easy to miss what is being said by the book or to write it off as pure insanity if you do not spend time breaking down the passage. However, even seemingly minute or frivolous details speak to much greater critiques of the stronghold grip Soviet society has on the masses.

Ivan Homeless in particular is a tragic character who writes poetry he doesn’t even really care about in general – he is a placeholder for the disillusioned Soviet artist who either decides to write Soviet Realism against their will. Homeless even tries to convince himself that his poems are good to a degree, but he realizes later that he thought they were garbage. It was not easy for him to get to this point, because he was brainwashed in much the same way most of the individuals in Soviet society are. He tried to tell the Devil himself that the Devil did not exist, and it took a long time for him to actually come to terms with the fact that you can not rationalize everything through the materialistic lens.

One of the most beautiful quotes that I read in this book was the quote

“How can man govern, if he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a plan for at least some ridiculously short period – well say, a thousand years – but cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow?”

In essence, not everything is explainable through the Marxist lens, and this is what the Devil espouses. This quote is relevant in the context of the Soviet Union, whose philosophical existence is predicated upon the movement of the masses and their ruling. By the people, for the people. Ivan certainly begins to doubt this himself when he realizes that his fate is out of his own control too. When he begins to play with these supernatural forces, and is eventually checked into a mental hospital, it can be seen that these phenomena in the Soviet Union were heavily frowned upon. Though this place is a mental hospital, it can also be seen as a representation for prison or labor camps.

Woland himself is a very charming devil, and is certainly different from the devil that is shown in Christianity, he is less a deceiver, and more a grandiose anti-philosopher. He of course shares a lot of commonality with Mephistopheles from Faust, whose magical and story-telling tradition Is apart of every page of this book. Woland does a lot of seemingly good things for his own devices, and is up to all sorts of conundrum inside of the Soviet Union.

When I was reading this book, I was wondering why he even showed up to Russia. Why is he in the Soviet Union, why does he care? This question stumped me for a little bit, and I was of the mindset that he did this because of his hedonistic desire to cause trouble, but I actually believe it was because of a greater curiosity he wished to satisfy:

“Have the city folk changed inwardly?”

At first, externally this is certainly the case. Buses, trams, new businesses and equality, it is easy to be convinced that these people have changed, but Woland argues that at their core they are no different. People are dishonest, elitist, incredibly vain, and are lovers of chaos and self-benefit. It reminds me of something that I learned in my rhetoric class. Is rhetoric coercive?

I would say not, because when you use rhetoric effectively you might manage to persuade someone into having an actually different opinion, whereas coercion does not result in people changing internally, but can cause their vehemence and disdain to boil up like magma on the inside. Stalin was an embodiment of this coercion masked as rhetoric. He was an individual who put on a masquerade of being just like us, of being someone who was there to benefit us or to help us. Comrade Stalin! He had the valor and appearance of a member of the working class, but he was fundamentally different than everyone. Of course, Woland is a satirization of Stalin, Stalin being a wolf in sheeps clotching. Of course, Stalin is also a devil in the sense that he would make deals with people.

People would deal with Stalin in order to get what they want – betray their brothers, create art that they don’t believe in, lie to those they loved. Every single person made a deal with the devil in the sense that they betrayed who they were in order to preserve themselves. This is why Pontius Pilate is such a striking and powerful character in this book: much in the same way that people in the bureaucracy would do things they did not want to to survive, Pontius Pilate’s regret of killing Jesus occupies a center point in these brief excursions into Yeshalem. He feels regret not only for killing someone who is completely innocent of anything, but he also committed the vice that he believed to be the most hateful: that of cowardice.

I think this section on Pontius Pilate is incredibly genius. Bulgakov makes the story of Jesus and Pontius pilate less commonplace. It gives a fresh new perspective to the story, though it is definitely sacrilege. I’ll say it: Jesus is the most heartbreaking character in all of literature and it certainly has made me question my own life. It reminds me of Vinland saga, and how Thor says that he has no enemies. Particularly, I read this book in a point in my life where I had someone that I vehemently hated and could not push myself to see them, let alone to forgive them. When Yeshua says that every man is good,  Pontius knows that he is innocent, but he knows that he is simultaneously a fool. This story line is one of the purest and most beautiful things I have ever read. I hope that Pilate gets to spend all of his time sleeping, dreaming of walking on the moonlight with Yesha and Banga for all of eternity.

The argument that the book gives is that cowardice is the worst vice because it is the begetter of all other vices. Cowardice not only manifests directly in Pilate, but also is prevelant throughout the entirety of the book. Varenukha is a coward because he listens to the government after being punished;  Ivan is a coward for being unwilling to actually create the poetry he wants, Rimsky is a coward for running from the Variety and Hella, and so on. Even more significantly, the master feels like a coward for not seeking his love and continuing to work on the book of Pontius Pilate, Margarita is a coward for leaving him the night that he is taken away by the secret police, but even more so, Bulgakov is a coward for being unwilling to submit his Pontius Pilate book, to try to make an effort to disappear from the Soviet Union.

This disdain for himself manifests in his portrayal of the master at the very end of the book when he visits Ivan for the last time, when he says that he is no longer going to write his book. The master’s book finishes at the end of the Burial, but Bulgakov, under the guise of Ivan finally finishes the book.

Beyond this book’s extensive use of allegory and symbolism, the book has so much merit as being a wacky and funny read. As mentioned earlier, Bulgakov is against authoritarianism in the political realm, but also in writing as well. Bulgakov is able to mix magical, exuding Tom Wolfe-esque color and excitement, with dark and heavy handed realism in the Pilate chapters, and then a mix of the two in the scenes with Margarita. The author cares not for sticking to one style and being put into a box. This is also the case emotionally as well. This book does everything I believe, and is similar to Don Quixote in the sense that it has made me laugh to myself about cats drinking benzene, but also cry for the memories and the stream they draw behind them, as they flow into the abyss.  But, the narrator is never really speaking to you. He never really addresses the audience aside from a few key moments in which there are some fourth wall breaks.

This book is well worth your time, and is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. This book has changed my outlook on what it means to be free – it is not just about privacy. It’s about the freedom of the spirit: to not be confined to the banal and expected, how importrant it is to go beyond what limitations that what people impose on you, AND what you impose on yourself. One should not be like Pilate, or Bulgakov for that matter and succomb to cowardice. But in the end, it is okay. Because “words flowed in the same way as the stream they had left behind flowed and whispered, and the master’s memory began to fade.” We as heroes must “had gone into the abyss, gone irrevocably, the son of the astrologer-king, forgiven on the eve of sunday, the cruel fifth-procurator of Judea, the equestrian Pontius Pilate.
