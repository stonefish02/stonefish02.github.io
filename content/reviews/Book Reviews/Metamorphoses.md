The Metamorphoses by Ovid is an epic, transformative, and genre defining work that I have been looking forward to reading for a very long time. When I was in Middle School, I was classically educated, and as such read a lot of classic literature like the Three Theban Plays, the Iliad, The Aeneid, and so on. Particularly, we spent a lot of time on Horace and Lucretius, but we were absolutely forbidden to read any Ovid, especially The Metamorphoses. It was treated like a corrupted relic - too strange, too lascivious for people to read.

I always thought that this warning was a little strange, especially because these other plays and epics certainly depict pretty grotesque and mature topics. Why was the Metamorphoses so vulgar, while these other works are celebrated and not really thought of as such? I think in order to answer such a question, it is important to consider how subversive this work was when put up against these other epics. Not only subversive, but also transparent and self-aware - this book is completely packed with praises for Rome and Ancient Greece, but with a hint of criticism encasing quite revolutionary progressivism. While other epics marched with bulwark, rigid seriousness, Ovid is in the forest with Pan and Bacchus, metamorphosing the final form

There are many moments in this collection of stories where Ovid depicts (and maybe to a degree, endorses) same sex relationship, transgenderism, and other taboo topics. Ovid takes a more sensual approach to these stories, actually getting into the psychology of people in love with their sisters, total freaks of nature and the like. Ovid does a fantastic job of changing his voice from character to character, and is able to showcase their respective growth and contraction as things happen to them. In particular, this transformation and its consequences are not just present in the characters, but descend from the perpetual Flux and changing of all things, material or immaterial. 

This transformation is a thread that connects every single story. There is not a single story where there is not some transformation - physical, mental, spiritual - which creates a very cohesive narrative, in which ascending levels of complexity have led Ovid and Rome to where it is today. This common thread is the navigation device through which Ovid is able to subvert a lot of the epic tradition that was known at the time; Ovid espouses the belief that life is messy and constantly changing. Heroes and gods constantly make mistakes, and battle scenes that are seemingly spectacular are so because of the reality that people slip on blood or die shortly into their journey as well, it is not a well-choreographed masterpiece in which everyone is introduced and dies a hero’s end - sometimes people die after just beginning their journey.

Some people may really dislike this, especially because mythology is a well-oiled machine that might resemble more of a science rather than entertainment. But, for me, this satire Ovid creates is incredibly masterful, and was probably groundbreaking in its use of defamiliarization and its use in reframing the epic tradition as was known, but also other literature and poetry at the time. Ovid teaches us that man and god are subject to folly, that life is constantly subject to change and is strung together by such a principle. Stories like Arachne and the many depictions of Zeus and co. assaulting mortals and animals call into question the deification of gods, and demonstrate that figures that we look up to may be just as susceptible to vice as ourselves. This is where defamiliarization comes in - it truly does pay dividends in refreshing, and perhaps, metamorphosing our interpretation of the epic tradition, in fact demonstrating the hypocrisy, elitism, and vice that such traditions might perpetuate.

Ovid also, by merit of discussing transformations, also accentuates the circular nature of history, with certain people’s names being reiterated many times throughout the work, children of gods and goddesses repeating the same mistakes that their divine parents do calls attention the cyclicality of mistakes and evil - how even the gods and of course man are slave to fate. Though there are not 100 Aurelianos in this work, we see how these cards in the beginning (folly, good virtue, and all the rest) are then shuffled together to create heroes and then men. Even Caesar and Augusus are proclaimed as gods, but in Ovid’s meticulous narrative, he shows that even gods can in some ways be mortal - their pride can be murdered, they can feel pain, and will act upon it. Though Euripides and others could receive more credit for this stark antrophomorphization of the gods, Ovid is slightly more playful and accepting of such notions, using the epic tradition as a playground for rampant liberalism and freedom, rather than directly critiquing it. Euripides attacks it from the outside, whereas Ovid destroys it from the inside.

***

So to return to why my Pastors told me not to read Ovid: it is not because of what Ovid depicts, but the way that he does so. Though this work is a part of the epic tradition, its revolutionary air takes what has been commonly accepted, and creates an entirely new world. He twists - and yes, transforms - the epic tradition into something new, which necessarily will happen, as change is inevitable. Endlessly enjoyable, and more relevant than ever, Ovid’s Metamorphoses is a masterpiece embedded with so much wisdom, whimsy; gore and lust that it speaks to a darker side of human nature that is not espoused within the epic tradition - the shadow of our nature, and in-how accepting our ever changing form brings about unity.
