The Art of Rhetoric by Aristotle is a collection of Aristotle’s lecture notes and manuscripts detailing rhetoric, which Aristotle quickly goes on to define as an art. If you wish to undertake the journey of reading all of Aristotle’s significant works, this is definitely one that should be in the lineup and is certainly one of his more practical works. Though there are terse and dense sections in which Aristotle unfolds definitions into their consequences, I find that this work was more digestable than something like the Nicomachean ethics (though, there were definitely a lot of times where I would need to reread passages…)  which spends large amounts of time working over logical consistency.

Aristotle is very mathematical in how he treats these topics. A quote I will never forget from the Nichomachean ethics is when he says “it is the mark of an educated man to be as precise as the topic allows.” As such, Aristotle is very analytical throughout this work, but does not dwell too much on super tight logical consistency because that is not the point of the work. Rhetoric, as Aristotle details, works largely in probability and truisms that are only for the part so. Aristotle keeps rhetoric within its scope without dipping into other fields. This is a goal of his early on in the work – to stay within the realm of rhetoric without departing into the technicalities of other fields such as politics or law which are adjacent to rhetoric in the form of dialectic argument. However, one complaint I have of this work is that he does not always follow this advice, and will sometimes follow what he thinks is interesting, rather than what is conducive to building upon the topic. Particularly, when Aristotle goes into example as an analogy of induction to similes, he quickly departs from examples themselves and starts talking about storytelling. 

This lack of consistency is not just present in this context, but throughout the work as well. Aristotle at the very beginning of the work actually says that style and presentation are in someway manipulative, and are useless for actually understanding the nature of someone’s argument. Though this might be true at the base level, Aristotle then dedicates an entire section of the book to style and understanding the types of audiences you might be dealing with. Aristotle clearly thinks one thing at the beginning of the book, and later changes his mind about other ideas later. This can be seemingly problematic.

However, it is important to take this book (along with his other works) not as a book for the sake of reading, but more as a collection of lecture notes that Aristotle would use to streamline his own thoughts. One great irony of Aristotle is that his speeches were laudable, accessible, and beautiful; yet, his works are very difficult to get through, and definitely do not abide by the prescriptions that Aristotle gives at the end of the book in terms of concision and clarity. This, in my eyes, actually adds to the charm of the work. The work is not structured in the same way that the Nichomachean ethics is – it has a plethora of examples and scenarios, and especially in these sections can be thought of as a Rhetorician’s guide book. Filled with examples, counter examples, collections of enthymemes and stories, this book is a fantastic way to stir your imagination when it comes to entering the sphere of rhetoric.

One gripe I have with this, however, is that a lot of the examples are from classical Greece and are not very general. That being said, it is important to not remove a book from its context, but that does not preclude me from preferring other works in rhetoric for this reason. If I had to go back and do things over, I would have actually held off on this work and read other classical literature before I had decided to tackle reading this book. There are many examples in this book that I did in fact understand, but others that completely went over my head that I had to either look up or go into the footnotes section to get. Even then, I think that people who are very well equipped to read this book will enjoy it, but you there will be some examples which are too archaic to fully understand. 

I read this book while taking a class in rhetoric, where we have been reading 2 other rhetoric books simultaneously. This has been a wonderful companion in the midst of these readings, because Aristotle’s book (and of course, his predecessors) are the basis of the Rhetoric space. A lot of the things mentioned in this book will already be known by the wide majority of people in the context of public speaking or daily interactions. I feel as though Aristotle (and of course, a lot of other philosophers, but him in particular) are like the Shakespeares of philosophy in the sense that they are the light by which everything’s shadow is cast. A lot of this book may seem obvious to people nowadays, but that is because these sorts of books are what all of western philosophy is built on. 

Aristotle’s books are demanding; one does not approach Aristotle frivolously, otherwise you will not understand what it is talking about. It is amazing how dense this book is, and it feels like I could dwell on each line for 10 minutes. Aristotle’s genius stands the test of time (aside from sexism and some elitism,) so much so, that a lot of post modern theories are returning to examine Aristotle’s approach to rhetoric and other fields. Aristotle’s model of discourse, of beginning from some set of axioms and belief, some language or semantic structure, and then building up from there is how a lot of postmodern rhetorical analysis seems to operate.

In conclusion: Aristotle is crabs, and for some reason everything keeps evolving back into crabs. Thanks Aristotle. 4/5
