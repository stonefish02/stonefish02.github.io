+++

For my client based project, I am contracting for The First Tee Southeastern New Mexico. The First Tee is an international national nonprofit that teaches ethics, respect, and creates a growth-centered environment through golf. This program can be thought of like an after-school care program, but also has intersection with the general golf community through public events such as tournaments and Girls Golf. The First Tee is heavily affiliated with public school systems, and is known for training instructors in physical education. As mentioned before, The First Tee is an international organization with over 150 programs throughout the world. 

For this project, I have created a newsletter and brochure template for the Southeastern New Mexico chapter. This project has served to fill a deficiency in my WDTC skill kit - graphic design. Though I have had previous experience in software such as Photoshop, I have not used such software in the context of advertisement or communication. This project was difficult in the sense that it tested these graphic design skills with required adherence to style and branding guidelines.
