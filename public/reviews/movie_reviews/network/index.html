                <p>I watched this movie on May 25th under the supervision of my movie sensei Knox.</p>
<p>In this movie, everyone is mad as hell, and seemingly they are not going to take it anymore. We all feel on the verge of change, but rarely act—and when we do, we retreat into old habits. Even when we do make an effort, we change our minds because we want to go back to how things were previously. It is easy to feel as though we are simply viewers of our own lives, as though we are trapped in a 24 hour news cycle in our own lives where when we are happy we think about the next event or outcome that will increase this further.</p>
<p>Howard Beale is our inner voice - the voice which should motivate us to do the things we ought to do, but really, is a thing that is paraded around as if it were some kind of novel prophet. This novel prophet does some good in the world, but in a certain way also bolsters the very thing that is simultaneously ruining people’s lives. I think this is such a beautiful image; ideas or media that are antithetical to capitalism can actually be subsumed under it because it is marketable and has a demand. Beale’s voice (our consciousness) is drowned out by the mass-media induced noise.</p>
<p>This is probably the strongest narrative thread that runs through this movie; noise is everywhere in this film. Everybody is yelling at each other and screaming, people on the TV scream, colleagues in the office, and even loved ones at home. Though this is a humorous component of this movie, it emulates this noise displayed to us on the screen. It is difficult to turn off, because it has such a stronghold on our culture. It is difficult to go without speaking about the News or TV with people, and in large part it has entrenched itself even in the arts as well through literature, music, etc. Everyone has a certain noise that they like to tune into. I know I certainly treat the media I consume as the action will finally make me happy - that this little piece will be that which completes the life puzzle.</p>
<p>News and TV sell this to us. The movie makes a very strong argument that in fact there are no governments, they all fall under IBM, AT&amp;T, and others. The most powerful force in the world is not the country you live in, but who can grab your attention. From terrorism, to executions, to Communist militias, if you want it, you got it! Even ideas and events that are seemingly antithetical to the system we live in can be marketed to you, thereby forcing you to play a game that you cannot escape. Some people watch TV and treat it like it is their life, as if we can avoid the people who are right in front of us. Diana is the desensitized creator who is giving the masses exactly what they want to see, and Max is the disillusioned viewer of the theater that is going on.</p>
<p>This theater is not just in the movie, but is being shown to you in your life. The things that are told to us on news may as well be a TV show, because in the competition for stories that break headlines, comes a distillation that can bring about stories that are truly stranger than fiction. News seemingly is used to inform people, but this movie suggests that it actually is something meant to entertain us. News is not something that gives us utility - it can be the component to dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>I think Max represents an antidote to this constant desire for the constant seeking of stimulation: to pay attention to the life and humans that are right in front of you. Max is far from a saint - he lies to his wife, has an affair with a person who couldn’t care less about him. Max getting together with Diana is a representation of the constant desire to better our lives. More than anyone else in this film, he realizes his mistakes. Though in my opinion there is some lack of resolution or depth to Max’s relationship with Diana, there is still some profundity here.</p>
<p>He realizes he could have been a better husband, and maybe even a better friend to Beale. He recognizes that this is his life - that there isn’t going to be a moment where all of a sudden your life has started. His relationship fails with Diana because she can not love anyone, because she is not even aware of the people in front of her. Max shows us that real life is in the inconvenient, the unexpected, the flawed. Control in your life is in turning the screen off to live horribly and messily. Control over your life comes in controlling your attention - the most powerful currency there is.</p>
<p>5/5</p>
