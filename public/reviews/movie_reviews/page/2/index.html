    <p><p>I watched this movie on May 25th under the supervision of my movie sensei Knox.</p>
<p>In this movie, everyone is mad as hell, and seemingly they are not going to take it anymore. We all feel on the verge of change, but rarely act—and when we do, we retreat into old habits. Even when we do make an effort, we change our minds because we want to go back to how things were previously. It is easy to feel as though we are simply viewers of our own lives, as though we are trapped in a 24 hour news cycle in our own lives where when we are happy we think about the next event or outcome that will increase this further.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/network/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>I feel strange having written all these reviews that have 4.5 or 5 stars, but I feel as if I have been spoiled by my movie parents.</p>
<p>In any case, Good Morning by Ozu is a seemingly pretty silly movie. From button-activated flatulence to just wanting a damn TV to watch Sumo wrestling - not a whole lot happens in this movie. I think where this movie truly shines is in visual prowess. I wish Ozu would come into my home and show me what I am doing wrong. This movie is beautiful in terms of color coordination and set design.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/good-morning/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>Though I rate this a 4.5/5, as it&rsquo;s maybe not as impactful as something I would rate a 5, I have a lot to say about this movie.</p>
<p>To start, I am literally Max Fischer. No, it&rsquo;s not because I am into older women (though that has happened before and might qualify me in that regard.) No, it&rsquo;s not in my sheer genius at devising conniving and evil ways of getting back at my friend who &ldquo;stole&rdquo; said older woman. Yes, it&rsquo;s because I wish I could do the things that I want to do and not get bogged down by seemingly useless and monotonous stuff that I don&rsquo;t really care about.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/rushmore/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>This movie is a massive dumpster fire in a pretty cool way. There are some really interesting themes and a ton of meta moments that deliver a very cerebral experience. First off, I had no idea that the Orchid Thief was a real book in the first place. Then to make an entire movie about Charlie Kaufman himself, who is on the set for Being John Malkovich, struggling with writer&rsquo;s block over this seemingly random book is insane. This is a true story too, with Charlie Kaufman actually having struggled to adapt in real life.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/adaptation/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>The Big Lebowski.</p>
<p>This movie is interesting, because it has a really horrible Movie poster and at first glance seemed like another Hangover or Grown-ups type comedy movie. My assumptions were completely wrong and this movie has since grown to be one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Overall, this movie is on one hand about Nihilism. What is the meaning of life? Why is it that I keep putting up with the horrible things happening in my life? Why am I stuck in a dead-end job? Is it really all for naught? Well, one thing you should know: while you were sitting here complaining about such things, the dude is out there abiding. The dude abides.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/the-big-lebowski/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>To start, it goes without saying that this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. My roommate told me that this movie was shot entirely with natural lighting and this created a few very interesting effects. A lot of the aristocratic, various viscounts and countesses alike, had what appeared to be a somewhat sickly pallor. Many scenes in this movie looked like literal paintings. I feel like I could simply take a high resolution screenshot of a few scenes and hang these up in a gallery.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/barry-lyndon/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>This movie is uncomfortable in subject matter and also in execution. Suicide is a difficult topic to get right, as evident from media that depicts it such as 13 reasons why; that is, it is easy to glorify such things when the intent might be to de-stigmatize, but I think this movie strikes a very beautiful medium in portraying it.</p>
<p>Badii beats around the bush, he is pointed sometimes and in the end he gets someone to assist him in the act of taking his life. Again, there are super uncomfortable moments, such as the soldier at the beginning who knows his aim and won&rsquo;t do so because it feels wrong. Then there is the student who won&rsquo;t do it out of principle. These scenes are sometimes very awkward. Badii always talks about them, but never about himself.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/taste-of-cherry/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>Timothee was absolutely incredible in this movie, but I really feel like they dumbed down Dylan’s character here.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an issue with time (or more generally with these modern Biopic movies about singers,) but this movie feels underdeveloped and somewhat flat.</p>
<p>There are some important events established in the beginning (Civil Rights, Cuban Missile Crisis, so on..) but there is little to no exposition as to why he made the songs he did and the ideas that made Dylan of such literary importance. I’m not arguing he had some clear arguments on what to do, but there is a lack of Dylan actually changing with respect to these events. It sometimes felt like Dylan was sort of passively having things happen to him.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/acu/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>One of my favorite movies of the 21st century, Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is a cluttered yet simultaneously cohesive masterpiece. In this review, I argue that The Daniels undertook an ambitious venture by uniting the seemingly endless nature of reality into something intimate and emotional, an action packed that defies genre norms; it is a piece of media that simultaneously expands your consciousness, yet grounds your very being. <script type="text/javascript" src= '/js/pdf-js/build/pdf.js'></script>
