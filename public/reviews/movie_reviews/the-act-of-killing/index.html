            <h1 class="page-title">The Act of Killing</h1>
            
                <p>Wow, I mean just wow. This documentary is one of the most profound things I have ever seen, and immediately goes in the top 4 for now. In The Act Of Killing, fact is stranger than fiction as we follow Anwar Congo, a movie theater gangster involved in systemic executions of “communists” in Indonesia during the 1960’s. Tangentially, we also get to meet other affiliates in these death squads, and get the opportunity to see these people take main creative control of the documentary, where they reenact some of the killings and events that occurred during their time.</p>
<p>To start, I want to dispel the idea that this documentary platforming mass murderers is a bad thing, as it is done pretty responsibly. It is clear that you should not view these people as paragons of virtue or heroes. It seems borderline impossible to take away that these actions or people are good, especially when the &ldquo;mascot&rdquo; for this operation himself says that he knows what he did was wrong.</p>
<p>By allowing these people to display what they glorify, it immediately calls to attention how deeply unsettling the actions they committed are, and their attitudes in response to them. Depiction is not glorification, and there is a sense of irony that induces unease rather than praise. This problem of confirmation bias and glorification is not a problem exclusive to this documentary, and it is not art&rsquo;s responsibility to control the actions of people if it was responsibly constructed. There are several reasons why watching this documentary (or really any powerful movie or piece of art) creates better goods than the potential negatives.</p>
<p>This being said, Anwar is a truly interesting character, largely due to his inheritance of American culture, his getup, and the war that he is constantly fighting throughout this documentary. He is treated like a celebrity, and of course is feared by many individuals (yet many people do not admit this to his face.) As the documentary begins, we see Anwar detail some of the methods of how he would kill targets of the Indonesian government - he does so in a cold and objective manner, showing the viewers some of the easiest ways to kill human beings without a second thought. He even talks about this with his colleagues, random people from Indonesia, and it really seems as though no one bats an eye at this.</p>
<p>The people that Anwar are surrounded by are largely desensitized or detached from what they have done. Some have philosophical means of avoiding their guilt, some are wired in such a way that they are completely unaffected, while others simply deal with it. Anwar Congo admits freely that he has sleeping problems, and has nightmares. When he confides in his comrades with this, they say that his mind is “weak” or write it off as a chemical imbalance. Anwar has critical acclaim, is very wealthy, and clearly exercises a strongarm of political power. But underlying all this, Anwar still is aware of the fact that what he did was wrong. Whether he feels this manifestly is up to debate, but it seems that even in the midst of people reaffirming and praising things that he has done, there is still an intrinsic flicker of morality within his eyes which grows in intensity as the documentary goes on.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not really known whether or not Anwar actually does feel anything when this happens. He could just be putting on an act, and especially in the ending scene where his dry retching could be seen as fake. But, it is important to note that Anwar may very well have these horrible feelings that he has tried to repress. This makes it all the more horrifying that people with the capacity to empathize and feel could be mass-murderers. I really feel some echoings of Macbeth here, where the most heinous acts are those which transcend the limits of our emotional limiters and heartfelt associations.</p>
<p>I genuinely do not understand how Joshua Oppenheimer was able to orchestrate this - to allow these human beings to detail such vile things and laugh about them in front of a camera. But, maybe this is the point: we as the viewers have our own biases and pretexts for how we might think about Anwar and co., but these guys simply are living in their own world in which these acts they have committed are little more than nostalgia and remnants of the good old days. It really feels like Anwar is the only one who has some guilt regarding the situation. Maybe these people were under the perfect circumstances to torture, murder, and violate people. Maybe they did not have the education or upbringing to do this and were led to being “dropouts of life.” Anwar mentions that there are people who are dropouts of life everywhere just like him, which is a terrifying thought to accept.</p>
<p>A definition that is quoted throughout this documentary is that gangsters (preman in Indonesian) is translated as “free men.” The fact that gangsters are these supposed free men contextualizes further that gangsters, or people who wish to have freedom must subject the rights of other people - sometimes culminating in the ultimate infringement of said rights, life itself. Such an echoing paints a stark picture, in which Anwar and these other people believe that the only way to live a good life is to subjugate others, a reality that they lived, and others too. Anwar hates the notion of human rights, because he says that it is unlikely that others would allow him the same.</p>
<p>All of these mentions of killing, cults of personality, gangsters being revered as “free men” and as the pragmatic agents of social change, interspersed with these incredibly surreal scenes orchestrated by people who might be thought to be some of the most evil people alive, and maybe in history period, and you have one of the most harrowing yet illuminating movies ever. In this, we get a deep look into the psychology of mass murderers, and the thought that the distance between us and Anwar might actually be a lot smaller than we think. As Simon from The Lord of the Flies says “Maybe there is a beast&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s only us.”</p>
