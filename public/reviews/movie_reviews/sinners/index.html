            <h1 class="page-title">Sinners</h1>
            
                <p>Sinners was a breath of fresh air in the midst of Hollywood carbon copies, mass churned marvel movies, and some general disillusionment with modern cinema from myself/others.</p>
<p>To be honest, going into this movie I did not have the highest hopes. In the trailers, the use of allegory is not nearly as pronounced and might have a draw primarily through the novelty of Michael B. Jordan playing two characters. But, I came away being more than pleased with this movie. A lot of the allegories that really make this movie great were not very present in the trailers, and these slight subtleties took something which seemed like something banal and presented something much more ambitious and revitalizing.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Michael B. Jordan gives a fantastic performance in Smoke/Stack. Such roles can be difficult to pull off, but I feel as though Jordan renders a convincing division between the two characters, really making them seem like two different people. Caton was also a wonderful actor, I believe this being his first performance. Across the board, there were some very exceptional performances.</p>
<p>I also love how this movie looks - I find that the color palette shifts over the course of the movie, alongside the soundtrack which is a really nice touch. It emphasizes the shifting of music as an artform to some kind of commercial enterprise - or more generally, how our wrong decisions culminate one step at a time.</p>
<p>The primary allegory that I noticed while I was watching this film was the idea of cultural vampirism, and how the music industry (or rather art in general) can be victim to commercialism or appropriation. However, looking back, this is maybe a slightly shallow understanding - that white people have taken black culture and reused it for its own purpose disregarding the respect such creations deserve. However, there are some key nuances in the plot which induce a more sophisticated message: the characters who are members of the KKK are infected with vampirism, and do not become vampires until they welcome Satan into their household (or, maybe did so via their affiliation.) It is not that one person is single handedly at fault, but rather, that people make mistakes which if not resolved can reinforce other wrong choices in yourselves and others.</p>
<p>I think this is an important emphasis, because you can obtain the former potentially naive understanding as a special case of this lesson. However, this does not make it completely null and void. Coogler details how social or cultural vampirism is not just directly created by the people who steal it, but also by the people who create the art itself through “selling out.” Though, this might be a little strong, because survival breeds the necessity of commercialization and marketing yourself.</p>
<p>Though this critique of the music industry is important, above all, this movie emphasizes the importance of making the right decision - to be careful of Faustian bargains which may be apparently good things. The Devil is not an immediately terrifying creature, he is just a funny guy doing a cute Irish jig sometimes; The Devil is the person who shows you exactly what you think you want.</p>
<p>This notion is manifested in Sammie Moore, who is the son of a preacher who runs in with Smoke and Stack - who can definitely be considered bad influences. Sammie Moore makes many Faustian bargains throughout the film, beginning with his association with Smoke and Stack, accentuated with an involvement with a married woman, and then manifests in him wanting to move to Chicago to live the life that Smoke and Stack regret.</p>
<p>These Faustian bargains and the presence of the devil are likely influenced by the legends of Robert Johnson, a blues player who supposedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for awesome musical prowess. As such, Goethe’s Faust echoes quite significantly in this work, where Sammie Moore encounters a supreme moment of satisfaction where he wishes to delve further and further into squalor, which is the exact moment when the Devil’s grip over the work really begins to take hold. Everyone of these characters has made Faustian bargains, have made poor decisions, and at times have little to no self-respect.</p>
<p>There are so many beautiful moments in this film, such as Smoke’s alternative life where he holds his child with Annie, but because he did not make the right decisions he never gets to experience that life. He could have just walked away, but because he was too vengeful over people who made Faustian bargains like himself, people who were just like him, he lost the greatest future he could have had with the person that he loved. This was such an incredibly moving moment.</p>
<p>It is evident that these decisions are not just something that affect you only within a local time frame, but can come back to you much later in life. The ending scene with Sammie Moore as an old head at a jukebox joint is such a wonderful cherry on top - it ties some loose ends with Smoke, but also accentuates that the devil is just as active in our culture today. Though the focus of this movie is on the devils that exist in the music industry, it is a corollary that the Devil, though his existence physically can be called into question, very much reflects the reality that your decisions matter, and that seemingly good things can be your and other’s undoing.</p>
<p>4.5/5</p>
