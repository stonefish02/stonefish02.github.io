                <p>Hey kids!</p>
<p>What if I installed an information hazard in your brain? An information hazard is a thought or worldview which when communicated can permanently hijack your conscious life. Well, you’re reading my review so you can’t really avoid it at this point per Sunken Cost Fallacy. Did you know that it is an unfalsifiable belief that everything might simply be a creation of your mind, that all of your friends are simply figments of your imagination? Such a world view is called &ldquo;Solipsism,&rdquo; and though it is not directly espoused by people, has indirectly gained ground in recent years.</p>
<p>Such a world-view can seem inscrutable to human psychology, and as Schopenhauer says “can only succeed in a madhouse.” But, what Schopenhauer doesn&rsquo;t realize is that we do live in a madhouse. What Christof does is takes this to the extreme, by creating a solipsist&rsquo;s dream (or reality), in which the people in Truman’s life are simply trying to convince him that all of them are real. Though more literal in application, the Truman Show is a modern allegory for how Solipsism has become a cultural coping mechanism for those who are suffering from generational trauma, and has become a therapeutic guise for the cultural alienation we experience in the modern digital age.</p>
<p>This movie is more relevant than ever. It is very troubling to believe this, but there exist a non-trivial amount of people who espouse solipsistic world views. Terms such as main character energy or deeming people as NPCs are indicative of the solipsistic tendencies that our society and language has slipped into. Such vocabulary seems harmless, but is maybe indicative of some greater De-personalization/De-realization that has infiltrated the collective consciousness. We live in a world which has become more and more avoidant, even while opportunities of interaction and connection have increased. I have even met people in my life who believe in these sorts of things, and it has left me concerned and disillusioned.</p>
<p>Influencers such as Andrew Tate have espoused the view that most people live in a “matrix” where the true reality is obfuscated behind a constant desire to prevent main characters from escaping. It is no wonder that many people who have been hurt or experience deep insecurities find this worldview enticing: it reduces the complexity of people, which re-frames hardship and negative experiences into a form which is more digestible. Such a worldview can potentially induce the belief that people are really there to be of service to you, or moreover, do not experience the same pain that you might feel.</p>
<p>Truman is in a similar boat to people who have these sentiments as he discovers more and more about his unique position. Truman finds out that these people are here pretending to be his friend - that they are here simply to convince him of the fact that the world is simply as it is. This presents Truman with an incredible conundrum: he can either accept this new-found “power” as a person who is in some way controlling his own reality, and thereby everyone else, or, he can reject this notion and accept a more difficult road - one in which people are way more complex, traumatized, and real than on the TV screen.</p>
<p>The Truman Show is a sharp denunciation of such a world view. Truman is unwavering in his attempts to connect with human beings. Instead of staying in the safe and cozy Truman Solipsism World which was created for him by Christof, Truman takes the path of uncertainty, the path where our actions do have consequences and can harm those that we love; it is the path that most people are finding more and more difficult to walk in a time and world where people can not connect. Truman is a call to everyone that there is more to life, more to other people, and everyone is on the edge of their seat!! Everyone is cheering him on as Truman is on the threshold of the meaning and connection we desire more than anything else. Instead of us stepping out into this great big world that Truman walks, we change the channel… highlighting how Truman, who is the ideal of realness, in form, representation, and metaphor, is to the people watching just another NPC.</p>
<p>5/5</p>
