            <h1 class="page-title">Adaptation</h1>
            
                <p>This movie is a massive dumpster fire in a pretty cool way. There are some really interesting themes and a ton of meta moments that deliver a very cerebral experience. First off, I had no idea that the Orchid Thief was a real book in the first place. Then to make an entire movie about Charlie Kaufman himself, who is on the set for Being John Malkovich, struggling with writer&rsquo;s block over this seemingly random book is insane. This is a true story too, with Charlie Kaufman actually having struggled to adapt in real life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman were railing some of the orchid drugs from the end of the movie to even think about writing a movie like this.</p>
<p>This movie, of course, is a fever dream. Charlie Kaufman loathes himself the entirety of the movie, and his twin brother, Donald is kind of just living his best life. Donald also decides to become a screenplay person, and does what he wants, even if it is incredibly generic.</p>
<p>This movie touches on something interesting: I think it expounds upon Harold Bloom&rsquo;s idea of the &ldquo;anxiety of influence.&rdquo; Susan Orlean sets the standard, and now its Charlie Kaufman&rsquo;s turn to respond. Though her book is not necessarily anything special, Kaufman wants to make this into something truly special like Goodfellas or Schindler&rsquo;s List.</p>
<p>He struggles with him self in relation to this as well; he absolutely fumbles with someone he loves and just continually does incredibly cringe worthy things; he is deluded with visions of grandeur. This anxiety he suffers, that is, his anxiety about not being a generic writer, carries over into the rest of his life. I think this is genuinely how Kaufman feels, and his process in creating the screenplay carries over to the rest of the film.</p>
<p>In the struggle to not appear generic, one might see that it is difficult to come up with something truly unique, spectacular or interesting. Donald is an interesting foil for this reason: he seems utterly fine with not being unique or seen as the next Shakespeare and maybe this is some kind of portrayal of ignorance being bliss, or something to that degree, whilst Charlie simply can&rsquo;t get anything started.</p>
<p>But, Jonze and Kaufman set the stage for a very interesting analysis as to what it means to be unique, or how it can devolve into simplicity, they absolutely set this thing on fire. The end of the movie is a very generic set of action scenes in which Donald dies after giving Charlie a very brotherly, inspirational speech. Anyone who has seen more than 10 movies in their life (I just barely reached that threshold) now know that Donald is going to die. AND DIE HE DOES. Charlie gets the girl, the end.</p>
<p>As the movie proceeds, it feels the movie devolves more and more into banality; it devolves into everything Charlie hates in the beginning. I believe this is in part due to Donald influencing Charlie to go to Robert McKee&rsquo;s seminar, and just the increasing presence of Donald in the movie towards the end.</p>
<p>I think this is incredibly genius, and this movie starts to blend what is real, and what is not. Charlie says he will never meet the actual author, and then sends Donald in to meet her in order to dispel the writer&rsquo;s block. This movie, as touched on earlier, is a critique against how screenwriters try to faithfully adapt the work, but sometimes devolve in to Hackneyed Michael Bayhem due to time constraints or lacking creativity. Did I mention that this movie is hilarious too?</p>
<p>4.5/5</p>
