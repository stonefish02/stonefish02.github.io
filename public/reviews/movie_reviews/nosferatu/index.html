                <p>Timothee was absolutely incredible in this movie, but I really feel like they dumbed down Dylan’s character here.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is an issue with time (or more generally with these modern Biopic movies about singers,) but this movie feels underdeveloped and somewhat flat.</p>
<p>There are some important events established in the beginning (Civil Rights, Cuban Missile Crisis, so on..) but there is little to no exposition as to why he made the songs he did and the ideas that made Dylan of such literary importance. I’m not arguing he had some clear arguments on what to do, but there is a lack of Dylan actually changing with respect to these events. It sometimes felt like Dylan was sort of passively having things happen to him.</p>
<p>I think that Bob Dylan’s revolutionary character is sidelined for the sake of referencing other icons and significant events. The guy is weird, smart and incredibly idealistic and I believe that the movie sort of misses out on capturing that effectively.</p>
<p>I suppose as well that this movie is meant to be sort of an “introduction” to Bob Dylan, but I think it falls short. I think this is an ambitious undertaking and I think there needed to be more time to be intentional about who Dylan was rather than just characterizing him as a little bad boy.</p>
<p>HOMEWORK: watch Don’t Look Back and compare it with the film and see how Dylan’s depth is somewhat squandered.</p>
<p>3/5</p>
