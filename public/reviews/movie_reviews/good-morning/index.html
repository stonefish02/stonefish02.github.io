            <h1 class="page-title">Good Morning</h1>
            
                <p>I feel strange having written all these reviews that have 4.5 or 5 stars, but I feel as if I have been spoiled by my movie parents.</p>
<p>In any case, Good Morning by Ozu is a seemingly pretty silly movie. From button-activated flatulence to just wanting a damn TV to watch Sumo wrestling - not a whole lot happens in this movie. I think where this movie truly shines is in visual prowess. I wish Ozu would come into my home and show me what I am doing wrong. This movie is beautiful in terms of color coordination and set design.</p>
<p>Another aspect of his visual prowess, which seems sort of frivolous expands on something very profound: fake nicety and hospitality only serve to denigrate your relationship with people. In most of these frames Ozu breaks something called the &ldquo;180-degree rule.&rdquo; A lot of his shots have it so that the characters are literally staring at you, and then in the flash back it&rsquo;s slightly off-kilter. The perspective of the camera is as the listener might hear.</p>
<p>This creates an effect which in some way dehumanizes or makes the person look kind of &ldquo;phoney.&rdquo; They seem like wax figures. This seems a little strange, but a more commonplace example might be when you see NPCs in certain video games like Skyrim or Fallout. Faces stare straight into the camera and it creates sort of a &ldquo;flattening&rdquo; of people. It looks and feels inhuman.</p>
<p>This might seem unintentional, but I think Ozu is using this effect to critique our social interactions with people (though it seems more pointed towards Japan.) There is a lot of fake niceness portrayed in the film, embodied by this constant reiterations of &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; by the adults. This film is genius in a way, because the most pointed criticisms are always from the neighborhood kids who poke holes in the adult world.</p>
<p>Kids in certain aspects are smarter than us. They have not been weathered down by social cues and conventions. A fart is good enough. In the midst of all of these social conventions, a lot of information is loss. The adversity in this film is entirely based on the adults&rsquo; inability to communicate with each other. The kids literally took a vow of silence and were on a better plane of communications than the neighbors who have maybe known each other for a very long time.</p>
<p>What I took from this film: do less small talk, be more like kids. Sum this critique with the sort of &ldquo;homeliness&rdquo; of the film and the light-hearted humor that is more characteristic of the laughs we might share with our close bodies or family and I think you have a fantastic film. Thanks for reading.
I love you.</p>
<p>5/5</p>
