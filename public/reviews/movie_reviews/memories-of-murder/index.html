            <h1 class="page-title">Memories of Murder</h1>
            
                <p>Hey you. Yeah, YOU. You look a little guilty. Yeah, why are you so sweaty right now? You wont look me in the eye. You look nervous… there’s nothing to be nervous about here, especially if you didn’t do anything wrong. What have you been up to? Oh I see… That’s not what I heard. Why are you lying to me? There’s no reason for you to be lying unless you had something to hide. Yeah, I saw you walking around earlier. Everyone was grimacing as you were walking by like they knew something about you. I can tell when a man is guilty; I can see it in your eyes. Do you really think that bad men go unpunished?</p>
<p>Memories of Murder is a peering into the human soul - an attempt to defog the eyes of the wicked and thus open a window into the truth. However, such a process only unveils an apparent truth: the one that we have already accepted ourselves.</p>
<p>Detective Park is the head of an unsolved serial rape and murder case that has plagued South Korea’s history which remained unsolved until as recent as 2019. Park is the epitome of a dirty cop: using ruthless interrogation, intimidation, and dishonesty in order to find his man. Park’s motivations, however, are not solely motivated by prestige or fame. Park is utterly convinced that he can tell when a man is guilty - that he can shoot laser beams into criminals&rsquo; skulls, ding, ding, ding, it bounces around and then procs the guilty organ in our brain. Park is an embodiment of the closure bias, which is a cognitive bias that induces people to seek an answer for a question even at the sake of truth.</p>
<p>Detective Park is not the only detective, or really, person who exercises this bias. Such a bias is incredibly prevalent amongst the superstitious, religious dogmatists, and even normal people. I experience closure bias everyday. It is one of the sources of discontent for people, even our friends, is sourced by seeking conclusions that we can not truthfully ascertain. Then, why do people do this? I believe it in part has to do with human psychology&rsquo;s unwillingness to accept that the truth is much farther away than we would hope. Park is simply one response to the unknowingness that pervades our daily lives, and how humans might deal with this.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, and am fully cognizant of this bias and maybe even the extent to which it affects my life. Closure bias is not purely abstract, I feel it too. Maybe even in this review&hellip; Enter Seo, a detective from Seoul who is utterly obsessed with the purest form of truth, even at the cost of pain, suffering, and confusion. Seo is a character who reminds us that no matter how rational we might be, we are still susceptible to these cognitive biases even when truth matters the most. Seo resonates with me quite extensively as I try to be as unbiased as possible, or to get to the heart of the matter no matter how grueling it is. But there is something even more grueling than this process: never getting to the truth in the first place.</p>
<p>This movie is absolutely masterful in detailing how Seo falls into the claws of bias. He begins as a cold, calculated detective, and then eventually devolves into a dirty copy just like Detective Park, which is the very thing he tried to avoid. Park is a seeming foil of Seo at first, but in the end they actually are the same person. Seo helps Park to see that some cases or inquiries are never so simple, Park shows Seo that maybe telling ourselves lies is more comfortable than the unobtainability of a valid conclusion. Moreover, some people can become convinced of the lies we tell them. Guilt is not always a negative response to something you yourself did wrong, but may simply be the BELIEF that you did so. The first suspect is manipulated into believing he did something wrong, which is not something uncommon to a lot of relationships with an abusive tinge.</p>
<p>After hitting a dead-end, both of these detectives become convinced that the second suspect is the killer, having caught a person doing licentious activities which vaguely resemble the actions of the killer. The viewer likely is convinced as well too, I know I certainly was in some capacity. All of this certainty comes crumbling down, which marks Seo’s decline, in which he is utterly convinced of the guilt of the third suspect named Hyeon-gyu. Bong Joon Ho employs close up face shots of Hyeon-gyu in which he exhibits all possible signs of guilt: bloodshot eyes, a shivering away from the gaze of a scrutinizing eye, an all-consuming blackness which absorbs every ounce of innocence. The killer then strikes again, with Seo encroaching upon the body of yet another victim.</p>
<p>This scene is unbelievably shot. The gritty, noir coloring is a choice that represents the stark shadow that is casted by the murderer; it is a sick and twisted deluge in which Seo and Park are ever drowning, gasping for air - the truth that sustains our living in the first place. I felt a tingle go up my spine, and a narrowing of my vision in the face of an insurmountably large obstacle, a scathing pain that crept across my heart which diffused in a wave of goose bumps along the back of my neck. It was sublime, and there is no other way of describing it.</p>
<p>Seo eventually encounters Hyeon-gyu and begins mercilessly beating him with the aim of killing him. Seo only had to wait for a day or two longer to know for certain that he is the killer. But Seo proceeds with his own justice, utterly convinced of his guilt from the onset, where it is revealed that the DNA does not match up with Hyeon-gyu.</p>
<p>The movie then skips to some years later, in which Detective Park seems to have moved on from his days as a detective. He returns to the spot in which the first victim was found, reminiscing over times past. A little girl mentions that another man was there doing the same thing. Park asks what he looks like, and she replies that he was ordinary. Just like any other person. Park peers into the camera - he peers into the murderer’s eyes. But he doesn’t just look into his eyes, he is looking into yours. Park is reminding us that though the killer is out there somewhere, that the same capacity for evil is within all of us, and could even be you. Ordinary people do evil things, and sometimes for seemingly no reason, as Kurosawa illustrates in Cure. Both of these movies echo a startling truth, perhaps the only truth we can know - that in our killer being ordinary, indistinguishable from anyone else’s face - lies the abyss. The face Park stares into is the killer, yours, mine, and everyone else’s.</p>
<p>5/5, I think I really like Crime-Noirs.</p>
