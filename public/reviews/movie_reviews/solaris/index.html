            <h1 class="page-title">Solaris</h1>
            
                <p>Solaris is not a Sci-Fi film that expands the world, but contracts it until it comes caving in on the very makeup of our existence: memory, emotion, and the nature experience itself.</p>
<p>Having watched movies such as Ex Machina and Annihilation by Alex Garland, I have developed a new taste for certain breeds of Sci-Fi movies. I realized that I tend to prefer Sci-Fi that forgets space, and explores the mind, rather than cool or breath-taking intellectual property. Both films were thought-provoking and gorgeously rendered, yet neither of those movies was able to fully capture the essence of what I would consider a 5 star movie; there was some kind of slight innate incompleteness that I was unable to grasp.</p>
<p>After watching Solaris (my first Tarkovsky), I understand a little bit more about why I thought this. I would be completely surprised if Garland had not watched this before he created either of these movies. Though Garland had different source material and some novel ideas, Solaris is comparatively speaking a more complete experience. I believe that Solaris is a movie that could be endlessly digested and re-watched, especially with its rich references to literature and art, making Alex Garland’s works, though wonderful, potentially being diluted corollaries to Solaris.</p>
<p>Solaris slaked my thirst for certain hypothetical quandaries, but simultaneously has opened up a few quandaries that are not straightforward to answer:</p>
<p>Should knowledge be pushed even at the cost of human morality? What is the difference between memory and reality? Is Hari really a mere suspension of particles?</p>
<p>There are many other questions this movie begs, but I find these to be the most illuminating. The potential answers to this question are anthropomorphized and experienced by the characters who are suspended in Solaris’ orbit: The Faustian Sartorius, pursuing the immortality our bleak-scholar makes deals with the devil in order to obtain; Snaut, the disillusioned academic who sees science as a way of extending the border of a country, science as a mere compensation for the truth; and finally Kris Kelvin.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is certainly under the impression that science should be used even at the cost of morality. At the very beginning of the movie in his dialogues with Burton, it is evident that Kris is slightly insensitive to Burton’s experience - diminishing things that Burton saw with his own eyes, experienced with his own senses. After some sweeping, drone montages of transportation through Chinese cities, you experience some of the disorientation of some color shifts and auditory sparseness - an effect which prepares you for the screeching din and noiselessness of space and memory.</p>
<p>As Kris spends more time in Solaris’ orbit, he has an apparition that comes to him in the form of his dead wife Hari. Hari is very beautiful, but it is clear that Kris’ memory of Hari is slightly distorted. It takes her a significant amount of time before she is able to actually hold full-on conversations with Kris. It is revealed that Hari is simply a materialization of Kris’ memory, which serves to show how our notions of people can change over time; not only do we retain an image of people in our memories, but as we revisit these memories, we can rediscover who they are, or rather, who we think them to be.</p>
<p>Such remembrances are reminiscent of how Jung’s archetypes behave - we see that what Kris has stored in his memory is something resembling or displaying a consciousness, an indication that the memories we have with people might be just as alive as a human being. In the same manner that people change, so do our memories. For something so alive and complex, it causes the viewer to doubt her being a mountain of neutrinos. Tarkovsky is presenting an ontological limitation for human beings: we can not confirm or deny if something is conscious.</p>
<p>Though we might have certain feelings of the uncanny in these contexts, we see that Kris falls in love with “Hari,” and even to a degree loves her more than the Hari who had died 10 years ago. This is a matter of interpretation: maybe it is because Kris only remembers the ideal version of Hari - the lingering remnants of a sweet vapor trail from all those years ago; or it also might be that he was able to be more vulnerable with her when he recognized that the characteristics of people, those things we like and dislike in others is really a projection of our own experience or conscious interface. In any case, we see that Hari details how human beings have a tendency to seek safety in idealization of our loved ones, and also in other people. Moreover, it details that scientific explication and discovery can leave behind devastating emotional residue - shattered preconceptions, regrets, and haunting consequences - which echoes Burton’s concerns and disgruntlement at the very beginning of the film.</p>
<p>This is thought-provoking in itself, but moreover, this materialization of his wife provides a stark counterpoint to his original answer to the question posed above. He used to believe that science should be done for the sake of itself, and should be less concerned about human morality. Hari’s first and second death represent how loss changes us. Hari’s first death represents a change in Kris’ physical circumstances, but the second death of Hari represents Kris finally letting go of the fantasy. It marks the end of Kris’ old way of thinking, he mourns not his wife, but the limitations of emotional control and scientific objectivity and certainty. This meditation reveals the flux-ridden ocean of Solaris that flows through this movie:</p>
<p>“Nothing in the whole universe persists.
Matter is always changing. Particular things
arise as transitory images,
and even time itself, like a river,
keeps flowing on with never-ending motion.
For like the running stream, the fleeting hour
can never stop. As one wave drives another,
chasing the one in front, while being pursued
by one behind, in just that way time’s moments
run ahead and follow and are always new.
For what was once ahead is left behind,
what did not exist comes into being,
and every passing instant must give way
to some fresh instant. You observe how night
completes its course and passes into day,
how the light of dawn replaces darkness.”</p>
<p>Ovid’s Metamorphoses</p>
