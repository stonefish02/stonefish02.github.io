</p>
    <p><p>Solaris is not a Sci-Fi film that expands the world, but contracts it until it comes caving in on the very makeup of our existence: memory, emotion, and the nature experience itself.</p>
<p>Having watched movies such as Ex Machina and Annihilation by Alex Garland, I have developed a new taste for certain breeds of Sci-Fi movies. I realized that I tend to prefer Sci-Fi that forgets space, and explores the mind, rather than cool or breath-taking intellectual property. Both films were thought-provoking and gorgeously rendered, yet neither of those movies was able to fully capture the essence of what I would consider a 5 star movie; there was some kind of slight innate incompleteness that I was unable to grasp.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/solaris/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>Hey you. Yeah, YOU. You look a little guilty. Yeah, why are you so sweaty right now? You wont look me in the eye. You look nervous… there’s nothing to be nervous about here, especially if you didn’t do anything wrong. What have you been up to? Oh I see… That’s not what I heard. Why are you lying to me? There’s no reason for you to be lying unless you had something to hide. Yeah, I saw you walking around earlier. Everyone was grimacing as you were walking by like they knew something about you. I can tell when a man is guilty; I can see it in your eyes. Do you really think that bad men go unpunished?</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/memories-of-murder/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>Hey kids!</p>
<p>What if I installed an information hazard in your brain? An information hazard is a thought or worldview which when communicated can permanently hijack your conscious life. Well, you’re reading my review so you can’t really avoid it at this point per Sunken Cost Fallacy. Did you know that it is an unfalsifiable belief that everything might simply be a creation of your mind, that all of your friends are simply figments of your imagination? Such a world view is called &ldquo;Solipsism,&rdquo; and though it is not directly espoused by people, has indirectly gained ground in recent years.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/cure/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>Hey, it’s been a while. Who are you?</p>
<p>I haven’t written a review in some time. There’s a long list of movies that need to be explored. But maybe I’ve been suffering from Anxiety of Influence from reading too much Pauline Kael, or I’ve had too much to say about a movie and thereby not enough gall to post something I might deem as incomplete.</p>
<p>Until recently, I was maybe dreading my impulse to write a review for everything. After watching Cure, after I came back up plumbing down in the questions of self, after recognizing the horrifying screech and din of the most common ambient noises, it permanently changed my brain chemistry…. I knew I had to write a review immediately.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/the-truman-show/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>Utterly baffling. The worst movie I have ever seen, which has quite the allure. My personal hell consists in being the football passed between Johnny and his supposed best friend Mark. Is Tommy even playing a character or is he just in the movie?</p>
<p>0/5 or 5/5, imagine you take the equivalence relation ~ that maps 0 to 1 on the interval [0,1) and you get S^1. This movie is the unit circle.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/the-room/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p class="blog-post-info">Posted: <time>2025-02-24</time>
    


</p>
    <p><p>The Last Showgirl is an American film released in 2024 starring Pamela Anderson. Pamela plays Shelly Gardner, a long term Showgirl at La Razzle Dazzle. She possesses an innate struggle with her occupation and her role as a mother, and also the general stigmatization of showgirl business. Such struggle manifests in prejudice, self-hatred, and a desire for amending her relationship with her daughter and other dancers. This movie investigates some heavy topics, including mortality, beauty, and motherhood, all of which blend together to create a very touching meditation. However, there are a few crucial problems with this film.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/the-last-showgirl/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>I watched this movie under the supervision of my movie sensei Knox.</p>
<p>Dr. Strangelove is a military man’s wet dream, but it is certainly not a blonde haired bombshell. No, Dr. Strangelove makes the argument that the military men’s hyper masculinity and love for military superiority is so perverse that it may as well be a form of…. Strange love. Phallic imagery is on display throughout this movie, such as the airplace refueling scene, and the B52 dangling superimposed in the sky. It is very reminiscent of Thomas Pynchon, in which he equates the American rocket to the phallus. Even the president is talking like he is in bed with the Russian president.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/dr.-strangelove/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>I watched this movie under the supervision of my movie senseis Eben and Knox.</p>
<p>Annihilation. This movie has a somewhat unlikable cast of characters, and it feels as though there are a lot of gaps in this movie’s motivation. Yes, I get it that these characters are incredibly troubled and thus are willing to essentially go on a suicide mission to obtain more information about the light house, but why only these 5 people? I know they are all crazy and traumatized, but still. Maybe I should care less about the lens cap being on the camera, but I feel like this movie leaves a lot of questions regarding the characters and their motives. Another gripe I have is that the dialogue is incredibly simplistic. Though, it could be argued that this simple dialogue is rather sparse intentionally, which could be lending to the general puzzle that is this film. The characters at times felt somewhat flat, which led me to feeling slightly disconnected from the film at times.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/annihlation/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>Wow, I mean just wow. This documentary is one of the most profound things I have ever seen, and immediately goes in the top 4 for now. In The Act Of Killing, fact is stranger than fiction as we follow Anwar Congo, a movie theater gangster involved in systemic executions of “communists” in Indonesia during the 1960’s. Tangentially, we also get to meet other affiliates in these death squads, and get the opportunity to see these people take main creative control of the documentary, where they reenact some of the killings and events that occurred during their time.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/the-act-of-killing/">Read more...</a></span>

</p>
    <p><p>Sinners was a breath of fresh air in the midst of Hollywood carbon copies, mass churned marvel movies, and some general disillusionment with modern cinema from myself/others.</p>
<p>To be honest, going into this movie I did not have the highest hopes. In the trailers, the use of allegory is not nearly as pronounced and might have a draw primarily through the novelty of Michael B. Jordan playing two characters. But, I came away being more than pleased with this movie. A lot of the allegories that really make this movie great were not very present in the trailers, and these slight subtleties took something which seemed like something banal and presented something much more ambitious and revitalizing.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/reviews/movie_reviews/sinners/">Read more...</a></span>
