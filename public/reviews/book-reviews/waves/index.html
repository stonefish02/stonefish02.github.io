            <h1 class="page-title">The Waves by Virginia Woolf</h1>
            
                <p>The Waves is one of those books one simply must read.</p>
<p>This book is so good… it is incredibly sublime. It is not an easy read and this book definitely benefits from a slow, deep read (much like Woolf’s other works in general.) This book is a stream of consciousness style embodied, but it is so much sweeter and more predictable than Joyce or Pynchon (not knocking the two by any means.) The book is incredibly melodic and transcendent, emphasizing the ebbs and flows of prose. The premise of this book is genius as a whole.</p>
<p>I was sitting in my silly little chair in my room one day reading my books, when I catch a glimpse of The Waves peaking at mẹ from my shelf. For some reason, the cover of the book was so enticing such that I read a few pages. Just in the first three pages I was absolutely blown away by the poetic prose of this book. After spending a night reading eight pages or so, I knew I had to start this book immediately.</p>
<p>I read To The Lighthouse previously, but I did so rather haphazardly, bumbling through the book in a few days simply to say I had read it. I made a New Years resolution to take my book reading more seriously, and to be less vain about my literary success. So, when I undertook this book it was not a light matter reading this over the period of like 40 days. I am so happy I approached this book with respect, because this is a book that I will be returning to again and again.</p>
<p>I felt such a spectrum of emotions reading this book that it felt like I was simultaneously overjoyed and in anguish. I still feel so much after reading his book. Sometimes I thought I knew where the book was going, like there was some raft for me to sit and peer into the waves, then at other times I felt like I was drowning. The book is predictable, but also not. Bliss, and then feeling like Virginia Woolf was insulting me for an entire section.</p>
<p>But, this is the point. Life can be incredibly simple yet of the utmost complexity. Life can be beautiful, yet bitter and unlivable. Such experiences and qualia are not a thing that can ever be described by words. We can certainly try our best with words and phrases, but sometimes it feels like they fall flat, and in some sense, they were always destined to fall flat. Can one describe the infiniteness of consciousness using words, phrases or concepts? Our poetic biographer thinks not, or that in trying to describe it, we lose the essence of it.</p>
<p>We can try to describe our lives to other people, we can tell stories to people. But which story is the true one? Does there exist a true story? Such questions remain core and integral to this story as well. We tell each other and ourselves stories all the time and we are deeply composed by these stories. But, these stories are like an ouroboros - a complex system that constantly feeds and propagates itself. The story that we tell about ourselves is also composed of the stories we tell about other people. We change with respect to what people have done to us, or what we interpret as their doing. However, the other person might change with respect to how we treat them, how we graft our stories onto them and they onto us. Talk about a highly non-linear, overdetermined system.</p>
<p>Woolf treats identity as something fluid, something that does not have a clear boundary: something that is undulating and changing as we come together, and are split apart; something that is added then divided and so on. This just confirmed a worldview I had with regards to identity: it is not easily defined, and is generally a composition of other people’s lives, stories. I like to think we’re made of memes that have survived the filter of a mind.</p>
<p>When someone asks you “Who are you?” How do you respond?</p>
<p>Most people will respond with their name and perhaps their occupation. But is this really you?</p>
<p>Sometimes people will respond with a story about their upbringing with personal twists. Outside of the facts that you present, how can one tell their story truthfully? Bernard says that it is pure conjecture, and that no story is true.</p>
<p>One of the problems that I have always found was trying to describe myself to other people. Who am I, what am I about. Am I a good person?</p>
<p>What I’ve realized after all this time is that I don’t know who I am. It changes depending on who I’m in a room with, where I am in my life, and so on. What I do know is that I do have this life. I have this life in front of me, and beyond the fact that I and others exist, how can I find the truth? We might agree on some level of truth inductively, such as the laws of physics being in place or the sun still sits upon his throne in the center of our solar system, but beyond this agreement that takes place, what is truth? Pontius Pilate certainly didn’t know. Maybe the truth is what is right in front of us, the infinite of experience.</p>
<p>For such a large concentration of sense, of expansiveness, of suffering and enjoyment in a human sized frame, we are so fragile. Everything is all there is in that body, and yours too. There is something like an entire universe inside of another person, and a universe that exists when you interact with these people. When I am with someone, maybe I am no longer Stone Fields, but something more loose and undefinable.</p>
<p>This book also has challenged my military precision - my inclination to be rigid and to be avoidant. It has made me think more about when I lay my clothes out on my bed in the morning to get ready for class. It makes me think deeper about all the broken dreams, the lost relationships, the foolish mistakes, the unfulfilled promises, the relics of the past, and my inevitable death. All of these things influence my every decision that I make. Even the small things in life matter, because they are a culmination of everything as a drop in the ocean, but simultaneously, this drop could be like Ice-9. It makes me think deeper about death, and what it means to even be alive.</p>
<p>A drop much like time, time flowing like a river. At some moments you wake up, and are able to see, but it is inevitable that you will be lulled back into a manic sleep where you continue the story-telling, the grandiose phrase spinning, and when you have woken up, the drop has already fallen even further into the place we inevitably will return to - death, on and on - to the sea.</p>
<p>There are some strong instances of biblical imagery in this book, with water and dust being some strong instances. The dust of our past, the shadows that we try to grip in our hands, the phantoms that we toy with in our minds much like children. Water - the forgiveness of our friends and the erosion of our ego.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with someone very special to me recently about these sorts of things. This person might die soon, and was going through their previous belongings. They reminisced about their days in school, when their father passed away, when they were still working in their career, when times seemed simpler, and even more complex than times now. How scary and frightening the idea of death is. They told me that in these times, the only thing they can do is hold onto the present moment. Being close to death is one of those things that makes you question everything - you stories, who you are, what world you leave behind.</p>
<p>Did I live the good life? Did I do everything I could to leave my values behind? What story do I want people to know about me when my children, grandchildren and their descendants think of me? This book helped me answer some of these questions for this person. Perhaps all the stories we have told ourselves aren’t true. But, the fact that we get to share some universe together is enough to make it all worth it. There’s no need to describe such a thing with bombastic phrases or stories, because it would not be enough to capture the totality of it anyway.</p>
<p>Again, I feel like even though I spent such a long time reading, rereading, pondering about this book, there will always be something new to find and return to. For any of my peoples on goodreads, please give this book a read. You will not regret it.</p>
