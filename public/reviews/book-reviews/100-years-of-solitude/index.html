            <h1 class="page-title">100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez</h1>
            
                <p>One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a 20th century masterpiece which transcends time and space – it is a novel that occurs in the past, present, and future all at once and exerts its influence across all of space, beginning in the concept of Macondo, and exerts its presence throughout our lives.</p>
<p>To start, this book is so technically tight and cohesive. Concepts or events that are mentioned are very intentional in this work. It felt like there were so many times where I would solve little puzzles inside of this book, I would find easter eggs, or references from 300 pages previously in the book. This novel is such a sumptuous display of language and memory. It is hilarious, depraved, and wildly profound. This book is the full package, and never overstays its welcome. This is one of the few books (alongside Don Quixote) that I have wanted to immediately reread in its entirety. It felt like I had no idea where the story was going, but it simultaneously felt so familiar given some prior experience in history. This story is the story of Latin America, our lives, and the world all wrapped into one; but it might be thought that these stories are of the same essence.</p>
<p>This book was truly a wonderful treat, and after reading The master and Margarita by Bulgakov, I have developed a very deep appreciation for Magical Realism, which is a genre that feels even more real than realism itself. This book is one of my favorites that I have read in the past few years, and I believe that is in large part due to my upbringing in a small town in New Mexico. One of my favorite things to do is to talk about “Roswell Stories” in which people will listen to my insane stories about crazy people in New Mexico.</p>
<p>I remember Marquez said in an interview that everything that happens in the story has some rooting in reality. When I first read the book and read mentions of six armed men and people flying on magic carpets, I thought this was a silly thing to say at first. But, after having spent most of my life in Roswell, New Mexico, I realize how a lot of the things that have happened in my life are truly strange. After watching movie like The Act of Killing, and experiencing quite a few strange things in my time, I have realized that fact is truly stranger than fiction. After spending a good 8 weeks with this book I have realized that one of the key features of Magical Realism is its literalization of metaphors and proverbs from our own lives, which lend to the seeming strangeness of this novel.</p>
<p>This relation reminds me quite significantly of my childhood, but another thing that properly characterizes small town is the Buendia’s proclivity to solitude, and the fact that none of the members of the family never actually leave the city. Even characters like Amaranta Ursula and Jose Arcadio end up returning to Macondo – this plot point serves to demonstrate how people from small towns are apart of some kind of singularity, in which it is impossible for people to leave if they have their roots set there. Though some people leave, there are other who are in some way succombing to willful ignorance.</p>
<p>Solitude, of course, is one of the main themes of this novel. But solitude is not something that we encounter physically. Marquez puts forth a compelling argument that solitude can be largely self-imposed, and that one can be isolated even in front of those that you love. These instances of solitude are thought to be a method for the Buendias to exist even beyond death, which is shown by their ghosts lingering around many years later. However, an important lesson that Marquez tries to demonstrate is that all these times spent in solitude – in search of knowledge, control, power – are useless without other people to share it with.</p>
<p>Marquez takes a unique approach to this novel, detailing the lives of the Buendia family in what I believe is a Homeric-like oral tradition. It is clear that these are parchments, but this book has a certain musicality to it that benefits from reading the story aloud. What this creates is a broad, sweeping narrative about the cyclicality of history, which descends into people’s lives. Marquez use of repeating names such as Jose Arcadio, Aureliano, and Ursula details how our children inherit our neuroses. Marquez is maybe one of the most hardcore determinists I have ever read, this being in my eyes a story of fatalism.</p>
<p>This legendary family is mythical, borderline godlike, but deeply human as well. These figures are reminiscent of prior mythological tradition like the Greeks and Romans. Having read The Metamorphoses alongside this book, it is uncanny to see how myth and history are not easily seperated. Even Zeus is susceptible to the fates, even heroes like Aureliano are in some capacity slaves to their biology, their culture, their family history. It can also be seen that Marquez emphasizes how our past and future are just as present as our decisions in the moment. We have certain cards that are assigned to us and then reshuffled throughout our family’s lineage – an argument that we truly can not escape our past, our family’s past, nor our future in the present moment.</p>
<p>It is hard not to get depressed reading this story. People die horrific deaths before firing squads, our heroes (like Aureliano) become crusty, grumpy old men who are then forgotten and relegated to times far gone, people fall in and out of love and close their hearts. But, I think this is remediable even under Marquez’s fatalism. Under the descriptive claim that we live in a fully deterministic universe, we can forgive people more easily. The converse to this too is in recognition that heroes might simply have had the perfect conditions to become who they were, and that the end of the day the people that we idolize are simply human – people who too might have felt isolated and as if they did not truly belong in the world.</p>
<p>Though this book seems quite bleak, it has made me afford more empathy for people in the space of their lives, families in the span of our world.</p>
