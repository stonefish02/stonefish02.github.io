            <h1 class="page-title">The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle</h1>
            
                <p>How ought one to live life? What is the chief good amongst others? What does happiness mean? How do I get there?&hellip;..</p>
<p>Aristotle seeks to answer all these questions in the Nichomachean Ethics. This book forces you to be better. Whether you believe in the ideas of virtue ethics or not, this book forces you to adapt. Aristotle creates many intricate arguments about why one ought to be virtuous and what virtues to pursue. This book has completely changed my outlook on who I am as a person and has made me recognize a significant amount of my own shortcomings. This book condenses most of self-help culture that has been tainted by consumerism into 276 pages of lectures.</p>
<p>As such, this book is hard to get through. It is certainly not written and formatted like a book, because these are a compilation of Aristotle&rsquo;s lecture notes. It is very dense and difficult to get through. Having some training in pure mathematics made a lot of these sections easier, but certainly not easy. From long, winding arguments involving collections of premises to straight up mathematical proofs in the justice section, you need to really take your time getting through this book. This book is definitely in the category of art that requires intense deliberation and attention. Again, Aristotle is not asking you to change your life, he is MAKING you change your life. If you spend time looking at the arguments Aristotle proposes, there are some sections that are utterly convincing, so much so that they entrench themselves in your subconscious. Once you integrate Aristotle&rsquo;s process of argumentation into your life, it becomes a lot harder to deny the wicked aspects of your personality or actions.</p>
<p>But this is what gives you the capability to be good: being aware of virtue or vice, and feeling pained at wickedness is exactly what acquiring the virtuous disposition is like. Many people can be good incidentally, but Aristotle recognizes that intent and context trumps all. Sometimes, in the face of self-improvement you have to make mistakes to figure out where the golden mean is. It is okay to make mistakes, but to continually pursue the good, because that&rsquo;s what good people do.</p>
<p>One of the most important parts of this book to me was the part in which Aristotle dismantles Solon&rsquo;s argument regarding a man being happy only when he is dead, an argument which shows up in Book I of Herodotus&rsquo; Histories. Aristotle believes happiness not to be some culmination, a pinnacle of pleasure or an experience; he believes that it is a life-long activity blended together with relaxation and virtue. However, Aristotle agrees with Solon to a degree: though man does need some equipment to survive, it isn&rsquo;t that much. The truly good man does what he can in his circumstance, and admits that the the best man is the one who does the most good given his circumstance.</p>
<p>Though this book is definitely dated in some things, it is important to not remove books from their context. This work stands a pretty significant test of time, being over 2300 years old. The information presented in this book is timeless, but it takes a lot of time and effort to get through this book. Though there is no doubt that virtue ethics has long been superseded by modern ethical theories, this is an incredibly worthwhile book in the avenue of self-improvement. A lot of modern self-improvement content in the internet is watered-down whereas Aristotle&rsquo;s work is concentrated and impossible to ignore.</p>
