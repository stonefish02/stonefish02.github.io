Hello there, my name is Stone Fields! I am an undergraduate student in Mathematics at Texas Tech University with a minor in technical communication. I am interested in mathematical research, but I am also dedicated to effective, mindful communication and the exploration of the world and self. Initially, I was a humanities centered student in Middle School and High School. But, after taking courses in Calculus III and Linear Algebra, I began researching Riemannian geometry and decided to make mathematics my major. Mathematics has taught me how to think more logically, but has also ingrained in my the importance of resilience and entering the flow state.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we only have finite time and I can not learn all the things I would like to. As a result, I pursue the application of my major and minor through my research in mathematics, but also in my critiques of movies, books, and other media through essays and try to unite them through the umbrella of teaching and self-improvement. Ultimately, I believe that areas such as English, mathematics, and other topics are not as disjoint as they might seem.</p>
